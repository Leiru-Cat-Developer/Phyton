# Distance from camera calulation


Code uses Basic formula to calculate the distance of a known object from the camera

Step 1 : use get_colour.py to adjus for the colour you need.

Step 2 : use dist_measure.py to callculate the distance of the object from any given length

  Pixels covered by the object will print out on the terminal
  
  use this formula to calculate the relative focal length by using
  
  F = (P * D) / W
  
  then input these values i.e F and W into the variables
  
  F = Focal length
  P = Pixels covered
  D = Actual Distance
  W = Width of the object
